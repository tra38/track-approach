        The Frakenstein Destroyers liberated an underground research lab from the Pro Tech forces a couple of weeks ago, and wanted me to rededicate the location. Essentially, they wanted to turn this research lab into a museum to honor 'anti-bot' activitie. During the rededication cermony, the organizers asked me to deliver an impromptu speech, and so I did. A crowd of 40,000 willing students attended while I spoke meaningless drivel:

        A high-ranking member of the Frakenstein Destroyers was finally captured and terminated by forces aligned with The Computer yesterday. She was little more than a popular figurehead, but her loss would harm the morale of the secret society heavily. I assigned to deliver a quick speech at her funeral, to be secretly broadcasted to all members of the Frakenstein Destroyers society. I sought to use the speech to remind the people about what she was fighting for:

        The Frakenstein Destroyers wanted to produce some subversive propaganda that could be used to undermine The Computer's rule. They asked me to talk to their expert writers and 'instruct' them on the proper doctrine of the secret society. I accepted this task, as loved the thrill of ordering people around. I spoke, and they transcribed my language, word-for-word:

        The Frakenstein Destroyers wanted to rally their forces for a big raid on Pro Tech military facilities. The Frakenstein Destroyers were confident of victory in this battle -- they have the numbers to overwhelm the Pro Tech's superior firepower. They called on me to make a big speech to remind the soldiers what they were fighting for...and so I spoke to them, in words that they could understand:

        The Pro Tech society desired to rally their military troops to recover an underground research lab. This lab was recently lost to the Frakenstein Destroyers a couple of weeks ago, and the Pro Tech eggheads saw it as a matter or pride that the lab gets returned back to us. Though I knew their cause was doomed, the soldiers still needed some sort of motivation and hope...to be reminded on why they were fighting in the first place. And so I spoke, and the soldiers listened:

        The Pro Tech society wanted to auction off their latest inventions to various other traitors and criminals, hoping to raise money for research activities. The Pro Techers knew not to question what the traitors were going to do with their inventions, but still wanted to spread their propaganda to the various bidders. Doing so would potentially create sympathizers who could later be exploited. While showing off the cool technological devices, I spoke a few words to the various traitors in the room:

        The Pro Techers held a hackathon to train their new recruits in the art of programming. I was assigned to deliver the keynote speech...praising the scientists for their courageous and brave decision to stare at computer screens. During the keynote speech, I decided to touch on the ideological underpinnings of the Pro Tech society:

        The Pro Tech society desired to honor me for my propaganda ways and awarded me an honoray doctorate in Sociology. I made sure that this degree would not be publicized (out of fear that the Frakenstein Destroyers may hear of it), but was still pleased to know that my words were being given proper respect. During the private award cermony, I decided to deliver one of my trademarked speeches to a sympathetic audience:
