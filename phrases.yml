        And then, my life went on autopilot...I didn't remember what happened next, becuase I never needed to ever worry about it. I only take over if I needed to, if something important were to happen.
      - |
        I learned to turn my brain off at key moments. If I think or perceive, then there's a possibility that I may make a mistake. I automate away my day-to-day life, and only see if I need to see.
      - |
        After that, my mind went dark. And then when I came to my senses, I was somewhere else.
      - |
        You never want to remember too much. The more you remember, the more likely you are to incrimiante yourself when Internal Security interrogates you. So I black out my memory.
      - |
        I never needed to know much of what's going on in my life, and so I simply turned my mind off...only to turn it on when something important occurs.
      - |
        Life seemed boring for a time, so I closed my eyes, and allowed for my life to go on autopilot. When I open my eyes....
      - |
        Happy with my life, I went to sleep, and then woke up in a whole new scenario...
      - |
        I then close my eyes, to feel the bliss of ignorance, and only relucantly opened them when necessary.
      - |
        I wanted to sleep, and so I slept, for a short period of time. Do others sleep too? They must have, for how else can they stay sane here?
      - |
        I rewarded my actions by returning myself to the bliss of ignorance, and then was rudely awakened by a voice calling me back to reality.
      - |
        And then I began to move without me being controlled...I just followed orders that other said, without even understanding them or thinking about what these orders mean. This was normal though, so I accepted my lot in life, and send myself into sleep for a brief period of time.
      - |
        And as I walked away, I saw an Internal Security goon staring at me. He examined me closely, and then moved onto his next target. Did Internal Security knew my secrets? Or was he just trying to scare me?
      - |
        And as I walked away, I saw a Communist phamplet on the floor, stating that it would describe the Truth about The Computer. I ignored the phamplet, for I knew that Communism is an evil ideology, one that everyone hates. To even look at their evil words would be to damn me as a criminal forever. Not even Pro Tech or the Frakenstein Destroyers would accept me back in their ranks. The phamplet must be a trap, and I (luckily) avoided that trap.
        And yet I began to wonder...if it was a trap, who wanted to entrap me?
      - |
        And as I walked away, I thought about ethics. Am I ethical? Am I doing the right thing in Alpha Complex? Or am I an evil person, destined for eternal cursing by the philosophers? I then dismissed such thoughts from my head...if I am unethical, it is because society is unethical, and it is harder to fix a society than it is to just blame the man who lives in it.

        Feeling a sense of disappointment in my life, I send myself into the bliss of autopilot and then spent my time trying to imagine a better future. Not a future where I get wealth, glory, and fame by becoming a High Programmer. No, an actual better future. One where Alpha Complex is an actual functioning state, with a sane leadership and a competent government. But then I realize that such imagination would be futile, like imagining unicorns and ponies. The governments of the past were not competent...they made mistakes far more horrifying than The Computer ever did. The only difference between the human politicians of the past and the machine politician of today is that the humans lied about their intentions, while The Computer is brutually honest. Maybe that is the better future?

        I wanted to turn my mind off, to go back into the bliss of autopilot. But I couldn't because right then and there...and then I saw something horrible happen. I was glad that my memory blanked out the details, but I knew it was horrible. I *knew* that I should have intervened, when I saw the injustice, and I *knew* that I couldn't do it because...well, because I didn't want to get in trouble. There are many factions in Alpha Complex, and if I was to fight for justice, I would be killed. That's just a fact. I knew what happened back then wrong...was that enough? Luckily, I didn't have to dwell on this any further, because another situation occurred to distract me from my fear...
